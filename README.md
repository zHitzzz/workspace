# OS Detection Script

This project contains a simple shell script, `check_os.sh`, that identifies the operating system.

## Usage

```bash
./check_os.sh
```

The script prints the detected OS such as `Detected Linux`, `Detected macOS`, or `Detected Windows`.

## Requirements

The script relies on the `uname` command, which is typically available on Unix-like systems. On Windows, run it from environments like Git Bash or WSL.
